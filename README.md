## A photorealistic 3D renderer implemented in Python

As a form of recreational programming and in an attempt to dust of my Python
skills, I am implementing a ray tracer following the test-driven approach laid
out by Jamis Buck in his book
[_The Ray Tracer Challenge_](https://tinyurl.com/y7bap78k) (The Pragmatic
Bookshelf, 2019).
